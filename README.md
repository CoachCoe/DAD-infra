# DAD-infra

A single home for the DAD AWS CDK estate. An npm-workspaces monorepo with one
shared config/pipeline core and one CDK app per tenant.

## Design

The authoritative architecture, account/region model, and decisions live in
[docs/design/aws-infra-design.md](docs/design/aws-infra-design.md).

## Environments

- `staging` → sandbox account `853377042897`
- `production` → account `216833405626`
- Region: `us-east-2` (Ohio)

Environment is selected with `-c env=staging|production` (default `staging`).

## Sizing and scaling

Values live in `apps/dad-main/lib/config.ts`. No load test has been run against these
sizes, so the limits below are the configured ceilings and the levers, not measured
capacity.

| | staging | production |
|---|---|---|
| Availability zones | 2 subnets per tier, 1 NAT gateway | 2 subnets per tier, 2 NAT gateways |
| Database | RDS PostgreSQL 16, `db.t3.medium`, single-AZ, 7-day backups | `db.t3.large`, Multi-AZ, 14-day backups |
| Storage | 50 GiB gp3, autoscaling to 200 GiB | same |
| api / web task | 0.5 vCPU, 1 GiB | 1 vCPU, 2 GiB |
| nginx / worker task | 0.25 vCPU, 0.5 GiB | 0.5 vCPU, 1 GiB |
| api, web, nginx tasks | 1 each, scaling to 3 / 3 / 2 | 2 each, scaling to 12 / 12 / 6 |
| Workers | 6 services, 1 task each, off until `workersEnabled` | same |
| Interface VPC endpoints | off (traffic uses the NAT) | on |

The api, web and nginx services scale on average CPU (60%) and, for api and web, memory
(75%). The floor is the configured desired count and the ceiling is `autoscaling.<service>.maxCount`.
Traffic enters through a Network Load Balancer, which has no per-target request metric,
so there is no request-count policy. Workers do not autoscale. The S3 gateway endpoint is
always created; the ECR api/dkr, Secrets Manager and CloudWatch Logs interface endpoints
(`interfaceEndpointsEnabled`) keep image pulls, secret resolution and log delivery off the
NAT. VPC flow logs (all traffic) go to `/dad/<env>/vpc-flow-logs` with
`flowLogRetentionDays`.

Staging is single-AZ for the database and has one NAT gateway, so an AZ outage takes it
down; production is Multi-AZ for the database and has a NAT per AZ.

### Scaling path

The first constraint is the database, not the web tier: every api task and worker shares
one `db.t3` instance behind RDS Proxy, which pools connections but does not add CPU.

- **About 50,000 users.** Raise the task ceilings and desired counts in `config.ts`
  (the autoscaling floor is `desiredCounts`, so raise it when sustained load sits above
  it). Move the production database off burstable `t3` to a fixed-performance class
  (`m6g`/`r6g`), watching the `DatabaseCpu` alarm and Performance Insights. Turn the
  workers on and size `taskSizes.worker` to the mail and Stripe volume.
- **About 1,000,000 users.** Add an RDS read replica and route read-only queries to it
  (an application change in DAD-Main), raise `maxAllocatedStorage`, and move to a larger
  database class or Aurora PostgreSQL. Split the worker tiers into separate services with
  their own counts, and replace the fixed NLB-to-nginx fan-out limits (task ceilings,
  NAT throughput) with measured values from a load test run against staging first.

Neither step is applied: instance classes are unchanged until a load test justifies them.

## GitHub Environments and deploy roles

Deploys authenticate with GitHub OIDC (no static keys). Every deploy job runs under a
GitHub Environment named `staging` or `production`, so GitHub issues the token with
`sub = repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:<name>`, and each role trusts exactly that for
exactly one repo:

| Repo | Workflow | Role (created by `apps/dad-main` pipeline-iam) | Environment variable |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CoachCoe/DAD-infra` | `dad-main-infra.yml` | `dad-<env>-infra-deploy` | `INFRA_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` |
| `CoachCoe/DAD-Main` | `deploy.yml` | `dad-<env>-app-deploy` | `APP_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` |

Create the `staging` and `production` environments in **both** repos and set the
variable on each (the role ARN is a stack output of the account's `pipeline-iam`
stack). The credentialed jobs stay skipped until the variable is set. `atm-infra.yml`
has no deploy jobs (the runner is held).

**The environment is the access control.** Any job in the trusted repo that runs under
the environment can assume the role, so restrict deployments in each environment's
settings: `staging` to the `dev` branch; `production` to `main`, with required reviewers.
Production is deployed only by a push to `main`: there is no release- or tag-triggered
path. Without a deployment-branch rule, a workflow on any branch could
select the environment.

## Offline verification (no deploys)

Nothing is deployed yet; the first deploy follows [docs/bootstrap.md](docs/bootstrap.md).
The checks below are offline and need no AWS credentials. CI's required `synth` check
runs the same tests and synth on every PR.

```sh
# from the repo root
npm install
npm run build
npx jest   # all workspaces; also runs the rotation function's Python tests (needs python3)

# per-app offline synth (dummy account/region), for apps/dad-main and apps/atm
cd apps/dad-main
CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=111111111111 CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2 npx cdk synth -c env=staging
CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=111111111111 CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2 npx cdk synth -c env=production
```
