# First deploy of an environment (bootstrap runbook)

How to bring up `staging` or `production` for the first time. Later releases need none
of this: DAD-Main's `deploy.yml` deploys the application, and `dad-main-infra.yml`
deploys infrastructure changes. (`atm-infra.yml` only runs checks: the DAD-Quality runner
is not deployed.)

Everything here runs once per environment, by an operator with administrator access to
that account, in `us-east-2`. Commands assume `ENV=staging` (or `production`) and a shell
authenticated to the matching account.

**Order matters.** ECS services cannot be created before the images and secrets they
need exist, and the API, web and workers refuse to start before the database roles exist.
CloudFormation waits for a new service to stabilize, and with the circuit breaker on, a
service that cannot start fails the stack. So the stacks are deployed in groups, with
manual steps between them.

## Steps

### 1. CDK bootstrap the account

```sh
npx cdk bootstrap "aws://<account-id>/us-east-2"
```

### 2. Deploy the foundation stacks

From `apps/dad-main`:

```sh
npx cdk deploy -c env=$ENV \
  dad-network-$ENV dad-data-$ENV dad-ecs-cluster-$ENV \
  dad-ses-$ENV dad-app-secrets-$ENV dad-pipeline-iam-$ENV
```

This creates the VPC, the database, the RDS Proxy and the per-login secrets, the cluster,
the three ECR repositories, the SES identity, the application secrets (with empty
values), and the GitHub OIDC provider and deploy roles. It does not create any ECS
service or task definition.

Add the DKIM and verification records from the `dad-ses-$ENV` outputs in Cloudflare. SES
starts in sandbox mode; request production access before sending to arbitrary addresses.

### 3. Build and push the first images

The services stack tags every image with the value of `/dad/$ENV/image-tag`, so that tag
must exist in all three repositories first. From a DAD-Main checkout at the commit to
deploy:

```sh
TAG=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
REGISTRY=<account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$REGISTRY"
docker build -t "$REGISTRY/dad/api:$TAG" -f apps/donor-api/Dockerfile apps/donor-api
docker build -t "$REGISTRY/dad/web:$TAG" \
  --build-arg DONOR_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=<public origin> \
  --build-arg DONOR_STAFF_ORIGIN=<staff origin> \
  -f apps/web/Dockerfile apps/web
docker build -t "$REGISTRY/dad/nginx:$TAG" deploy/nginx
docker push "$REGISTRY/dad/api:$TAG"
docker push "$REGISTRY/dad/web:$TAG"
docker push "$REGISTRY/dad/nginx:$TAG"
```

The build commands match `deploy.yml`. Build for `linux/amd64` (Fargate's default) if you
are on Apple silicon: add `--platform linux/amd64`.

### 4. Create the image-tag parameter

```sh
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/dad/$ENV/image-tag" --type String --value "$TAG"
```

CDK reads this parameter and never writes it. From now on `deploy.yml` updates it after
each successful rollout.

### 5. Fill in the application secrets

Each is JSON. Replace the whole value; keep every field (an empty string means unset).

```sh
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id "dad/$ENV/ingress/tls" \
  --secret-string "$(jq -n --rawfile c fullchain.pem --rawfile k privkey.pem \
    '{INGRESS_TLS_FULLCHAIN: $c, INGRESS_TLS_PRIVKEY: $k}')"

aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id "dad/$ENV/app/encryption" \
  --secret-string '{"DONOR_EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY":"<key>","DONOR_CONTENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY":"<key>"}'

# Optional now; the API requires both Stripe values or neither.
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id "dad/$ENV/app/stripe" \
  --secret-string '{"STRIPE_SECRET_KEY":"<key>","STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET":"<secret>"}'
```

- **TLS** is required: nginx does not start without it. In Cloudflare mode use a
  [Cloudflare Origin CA](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/)
  certificate for both hosts (DAD-Main `docs/edge.md`).
- **Encryption keys** are crown jewels. Generate them as DAD-Main `docs/operations.md`
  describes, back them up outside AWS before using them, and never rotate them
  automatically. Losing one makes the data it protects permanently unreadable.
- **SMTP** needs nothing: `dad/$ENV/ses/smtp` is filled by its rotation function, which
  runs when the SES stack is created and every 90 days after. If the first rotation failed
  (its log group is `/dad/$ENV/smtp-rotation`), fix the cause and run
  `aws secretsmanager rotate-secret --secret-id dad/$ENV/ses/smtp`.

### 6. Deploy the maintenance stack and prepare the database

```sh
npx cdk deploy -c env=$ENV dad-maintenance-$ENV
```

Then, from DAD-Main, with the cluster, compute subnets and workers security group from
the `dad-ecs-cluster-$ENV` and `dad-network-$ENV` outputs:

```sh
export DAD_CLUSTER=<ClusterName> DAD_SUBNETS=<ComputeSubnetIds> \
  DAD_SECURITY_GROUPS=<WorkersSecurityGroupId> AWS_REGION=us-east-2
# Once: create the `owner` role, as the RDS master, directly against the instance.
DAD_SECURITY_GROUPS=<BootstrapSecurityGroupId from dad-data-$ENV> \
  scripts/run-task.sh $ENV bootstrap-owner
scripts/run-task.sh $ENV migrate
scripts/run-task.sh $ENV provision-roles
```

`bootstrap-owner` is the only task that can read the master secret, and the only thing
besides the RDS Proxy that may reach the instance. Privileged database work is versioned
code run as a one-off task; there is no bastion and no human database shell. It creates
`owner` if missing, resets its password to `dad/$ENV/db/owner`, makes the master a member
of it (a non-superuser master needs that to transfer a database), and gives it the
`dad` database. Safe to re-run, for example after rotating the owner password. Verified on
PostgreSQL 16 with a non-superuser master (wrong passwords rejected, the password re-synced
on a second run, a quote in the password handled); not yet run against RDS.

Each task waits and fails unless it exits 0. Without `DAD_TASKDEFS_FILE` they run
the latest revision, which CDK just created at `$TAG`.

### 7. Deploy the services and the edge

```sh
npx cdk deploy -c env=$ENV \
  dad-services-$ENV dad-edge-$ENV dad-observability-$ENV
```

The NLB admits only Cloudflare's published ranges on 80 and 443. The list is built in
(`apps/dad-main/lib/edge-stack.ts`); check it against
[ips-v4](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4) and [ips-v6](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6)
before a deploy, and override it with `-c cloudflareRanges="<cidr> <cidr> ..."` if it has
changed. Set `alarmEmail` to subscribe an address to the alarm topics (confirm the
subscription email AWS sends). CI deploys pass no `-c` flags beyond `env`, so put either
value under `context` in `apps/dad-main/cdk.json` to keep it across deploys.

Point the public and staff hostnames in Cloudflare (proxied) at the NLB DNS name from the
`dad-edge-$ENV` outputs.

### 8. Configure GitHub for later deploys

For each repository's `$ENV` GitHub Environment (already created, with branch rules):

| Repository | Variable | Value |
|---|---|---|
| CoachCoe/DAD-infra | `INFRA_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | `InfraDeployRoleArn` output of `dad-pipeline-iam-$ENV` |
| CoachCoe/DAD-Main | `APP_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` | `AppDeployRoleArn` output of `dad-pipeline-iam-$ENV` |
| CoachCoe/DAD-Main | `DONOR_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, `DONOR_STAFF_ORIGIN` | the environment's origins |

The pipelines skip their credentialed jobs until these are set.

### Turning the workers on

Workers are off in every environment until `workersEnabled` is set to `true` in
`apps/dad-main/lib/config.ts` and the services stack is deployed. That setting is the one
switch: it sets their desired count, and DAD-Main's `deploy.yml` rolls only services ECS
reports as running. Turn them on once mail (SES out of sandbox, a working SMTP password)
and, if used, Stripe are configured.

### Autoscaled services and the app-deploy role

api, web and nginx scale between their `desiredCounts` and `autoscaling.<service>.maxCount`.
Their desired count is not in the template, so a later `cdk deploy` leaves a scaled-out
service where it is. To resize permanently, change `desiredCounts` (the floor) or
`maxCount` and deploy.

The `app-deploy` role may pass only roles named `dad-services-$ENV-*` and
`dad-maintenance-$ENV-*` to ECS tasks, and may run only the `dad-maint-*` task
definitions in the `dad-$ENV` cluster. These names are the generated names of the task and
execution roles in those two stacks; do not give those roles explicit names unless the
`PassTaskRoles` statement in `apps/dad-main/lib/pipeline-iam-stack.ts` is updated too.

### Database passwords are ECS secrets

No task definition holds a database password in `environment`. Each task has a
password-less URL (`DONOR_API_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://dad_api_login@<proxy>:5432/dad?...`)
and the login's password as an ECS secret under the matching `..._DATABASE_PASSWORD`
variable (valueFrom the login secret's `password` key). The URL form is used rather than
separate host/name/user parts because it keeps `default_query_exec_mode=exec`, which the RDS
Proxy needs. Each execution role can read only the login secrets its task injects; the
`app-deploy` role needs no secret access, since `ecs-pin-image.sh` copies `secrets` verbatim
into the new revision.

Deploy ordering: DAD-Main from commit 7506cbf accepts both forms (a full URL still wins),
so deploy DAD-Main with 7506cbf first, then this change at any time after. Rolling this out
before that DAD-Main release makes the processes fail to find a password. Rolling back
either side is safe while the other still supports the form in use. Rotating a password
changes the secret value only: restart the service, no redeploy of the template.

### 9. DAD-Quality runner: not deployed

Do not deploy `apps/atm`. DAD-Main's ATM gate and its Worker ledger are the single source
of truth for findings, and this runner cannot publish to that ledger (design doc §6.5,
DAD-Docs ADR 0006).

## Not verified

Nothing in this runbook has been run: no environment exists yet. In particular that
CloudFormation can create the services in one pass once steps 3–6 are done,
and that Service Connect resolves `web` when nginx starts.
